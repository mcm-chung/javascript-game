## Overview on how BlackJack works:

Blackjack is a casino banked game, meaning that players compete against the house rather than each other. The objective is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21 (busting). At the start of a Blackjack game, the players and the dealer receive two cards each. You have option to hit or stand to win the game!
